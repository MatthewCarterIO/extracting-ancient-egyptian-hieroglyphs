# extracting-ancient-egyptian-hieroglyphs

## Introduction

The immediate aim of this project is to extract individual hieroglyphs from any image that contains many and to save them as separate images. 

The longer term goals are to use the individual hieroglyph images to create a machine learning model that will:
1. Recognise hieroglyphs from non-hieroglyphs (e.g. tomb wall backgrounds, cracks etc)
2. Identify a few of them by name given a group of hieroglyph images.
